Grameen-foundation-Uganda
=========================

A project in R looking at data from Grameen Foundation Uganda. The Grameen Foundation runs a Community Knowledge Workers program in Uganda where volunteers across the country use their mobile phones to connect farmers to a central knowledge base of information on agriculture and animal husbandry.   Over the years, they have collected data on their volunteers and their work. My project was to look at the demographic data of the volunteers and some field data.
